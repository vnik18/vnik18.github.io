# About Me

I am currently an Applied Scientist with the Alexa Shopping Science team at Amazon. I received my Ph.D in Computer Science and Engineering from The Ohio State University (OSU) in August 2020, under the supervision of <a href = "http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parthasarathy.2/" > Professor Srinivasan Parthasarathy </a>. 

My research interests lie in <font color="red"> Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval</font> and <font color="red"> Social Computing</font>. In particular, I am interested in: <br> (i) <b> Knowledge representation and reasoning</b>, which involves extracting, interpreting and transforming digital content into structured knowledge representations; (ii) Performing <b>downstream NLP tasks </b> such as intent discovery, natural language generation, summarization etc; and (iii) <b>Understanding Human Behavioral</b> characteristics from heterogeneous data sources for interdisciplinary applications such as public health, shopping and marketing.
